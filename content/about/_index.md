The Census Linking Project allows researchers to create longitudinal datasets from historical US Census records (1850-1940) in order to study processes that unfold over time, such as intergenerational mobility and immigrant assimilation. But linking requires large investments of time and resources, limiting their accessibility to scholars with limited research budgets. With the Census Linking Project, we aim to reduce these barriers by providing customizable linked historical datasets to the broad research community.

The project uses several different automated methods to link individuals across Census pairs using first and last name, year of birth and state/country of birth. We provide a series of fully anonymous crosswalks between each pair of Censuses.

The website will be updated periodically as links using additional matching methods become available. We also invite researchers to get in touch with us if they want to add their own Census links to our crosswalks.

We acknowledge generous funding from the <a target="_blank" href="https://irs.princeton.edu/">Industrial Relations Section</a> at Princeton University and support from the <a target="_blank" href="https://pop.umn.edu/">Minnesota Population Center</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="https://nber.org/">National Bureau of Economic Research</a>.
