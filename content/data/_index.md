intro: Please select the starting and final year of your desired linked
  dataset.  You will then be able to download a ZIP file containing the
  crosswalk data, associated codes, and documentation.
para1: >-
  The data found above contains the crosswalks for each Census wave linked to
  every other (1850-1940). There are 36 crosswalks in total, representing every
  combination of Census years<sup>1</sup>. 


  The crosswalks also give users the option to select the linking method with which matches were created. Users can then merge into these crosswalks a wide set of individual- and household-level variables provided publicly by <a href="https://usa.ipums.org/usa/" target="_blank">IPUMS</a>, thereby creating a historical longitudinal dataset for analysis.


  In the above menu, "starting year" refers to one particular wave of the Census and "final year" refers to another wave of the Census. 


  <hr />

  <sup>1</sup> Note: Crosswalks with 1880 data will be added as soon as stable histids are made available. The microdata for the 1890 Census is no longer extant.
para3: >-
  For instance, if you choose 1900 as your starting year and 1940 as your final
  year, then the crosswalk will provide you with <i>histids</i> of individuals
  in 1900 matched to <i>histids</i> of individuals in 1940.  You will then be
  able to download the data (in .dta and .csv formats), codes used to create the
  crosswalks, and further codes that will allow you to merge in information from
  IPUMS and to  reweight the data. Extensive documentation is provided and
  should be consulted before using the data.


  In addition to citing the papers underlying the matching methods used, publications based on the data from the Census Linking Project must cite it appropriately. The citation should include the following:


  ***<b>Ran Abramitzky, Leah Boustan and Myera Rashid. Census Linking Project: Version 1.0 \[dataset]. 2020. https://censuslinkingproject.org</b>***


  Please also provide us with the citation of your work that uses data from the Census Linking Project [here](https://forms.gle/JxzztJqGNyBbxA7y6).
