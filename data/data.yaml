  Please select the starting and final year of your desired linked dataset. 
  You will then be able to download a ZIP file containing the crosswalk data, associated codes, and documentation.

  The data found above contains the crosswalks for each Census wave linked to every other (1850-1940). 
  There are 36 crosswalks in total, representing every combination of Census years<sup>1</sup>. 
  Each matched observation in these crosswalks is associated with two internal person-level identifiers 
  (<i>histids</i>), one for each Census year. It is important to note that histids are not constant within 
  individuals over time, and so cannot be used to establish matches. Instead, matches were 
  established using first and last name, year of birth and state/country of birth. 
para2: >-
  The crosswalks also give users the option to select the linking method with which matches were created. 
  Using the histid identifiers, users can merge into these crosswalks a wide set of individual- and 
  household-level variables provided publicly by <a href="https://usa.ipums.org/usa/" target="_blank">IPUMS</a>, 
  thereby creating a historical longitudinal dataset for analysis.

  In the above menu, "starting year" refers to one particular wave of the Census and 
  "final year" refers to another wave of the Census. For instance, if you choose 1900 as 
  your starting year and 1940 as your final year, then the crosswalk will provide you 
  with histids of individuals in 1900 matched to histids of individuals in 1940. 
  The ZIP file provided contains the data (in .dta and .csv formats), 
  codes used to create the crosswalks, and further codes that will allow you to 
  merge in information from IPUMS and to reweight the data. Extensive 
  documentation is provided and should be consulted before using the data.

  <sup>1</sup> Note: Crosswalks with 1880 data will be added as soon as stable histids are made available. 
  The microdata for the 1890 Census is no longer extant.
