abstract: |
  Ho and Reardon (2012) present methods for estimating achievement gaps when test scores are
  coarsened into a small number of ordered categories, preventing fine-grained distinctions between
  individual scores. They demonstrate that gaps can nonetheless be estimated with minimal bias across a
  broad range of simulated and real coarsened data scenarios. In this paper, we extend this previous work
  to obtain practical estimates of the imprecision imparted by the coarsening process and of the bias
  imparted by measurement error. In the first part of the paper, we derive standard error estimates and
  demonstrate that coarsening leads to only very modest increases in standard errors under a wide range
  of conditions. In the second part of the paper, we describe and evaluate a practical method for
  disattenuating gap estimates to account for bias due to measurement error.
