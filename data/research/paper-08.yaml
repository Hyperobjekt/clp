abstract: |
  A comparison of Chicago public school students’ standardized test scores in 2009-2014 with
  those of public students across the U.S. reveals two striking patterns. First, Chicago students’
  scores improved dramatically more, on average, between third and eighth grade than those
  of the average student in the U.S. This is true for students of all racial/ethnic groups. The
  average Chicago student’s test scores improved by roughly 6 grade-level equivalents in the 5
  years from third to eighth grade. Second, at each grade level in grades three through eight,
  Chicago students’ scores improved more from 2009 to 2014 than did the average scores of all
  students in the U.S. Test scores rose in Chicago by roughly two-thirds of a grade level from
  2009 to 2014, compared to an increase of one-sixth of a grade level nationally. Again, this was
  equally true for black, Hispanic, and white students. These patterns do not appear to result
  from increasingly test-aligned instruction or from changing city demographics and enrollment
  patterns.
