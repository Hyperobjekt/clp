abstract: |
  Test scores are commonly reported in a small number of ordered categories. These contexts
  include state accountability testing, Advanced Placement tests, and English proficiency tests.
  This paper introduces and evaluates methods for estimating achievement gaps on a familiar
  standard-deviation-unit metric using data from these ordered categories alone. These methods
  hold two practical advantages over alternative achievement gap metrics. First, they require only
  categorical proficiency data, which are often available where means and standard deviations are
  not. Second, they result in gap estimates that are invariant to score scale transformations,
  providing a stronger basis for achievement gap comparisons over time and across jurisdictions.
  We find three candidate estimation methods that recover full-distribution gap estimates well
  when only censored data are available.
