abstract: |
  Test score distributions of schools or demographic groups are often summarized by
  frequencies of students scoring in a small number of ordered proficiency categories. We show
  that heteroskedastic ordered probit (HETOP) models can be used to estimate means and
  standard deviations of multiple groups’ test score distributions from such data. Because the
  scale of HETOP estimates is indeterminate up to a linear transformation, we develop formulas
  for converting the HETOP parameter estimates and their standard errors to a scale in which
  the population distribution of scores is standardized. We demonstrate and evaluate this novel
  application of the HETOP model with a simulation study and using real test score data from
  two sources. We find that the HETOP model produces unbiased estimates of group means
  and standard deviations, except when group sample sizes are small. In such cases, we
  demonstrate that a “partially heteroskesdastic” ordered probit (PHOP) model can produce
  estimates with a smaller root mean squared error than the fully heteroskedastic model.
