abstract: |
  We use data from multiple national surveys to describe trends in private elementary school
  enrollment by family income from 1968-2013. We note several important trends. First, the
  private school enrollment rate of middle-income families declined substantially over the last
  five decades, while that of high-income families remained quite stable. Second, there are
  notable differences in private school enrollment trends by race/ethnicity, urbanicity, and
  region of the country. Although racial/ethnic differences in private school enrollment are
  largely explained by income differences, the urban/suburban and regional differences in
  private school enrollment patterns are large even among families with similar incomes.
  Factors contributing to these patterns may include trends in income inequality, private school
  costs and availability, and the perceived relative quality of local schooling options.
