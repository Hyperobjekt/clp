  This paper provides the first population-based evidence on how much standardized test
  scores vary among public school districts within each state and how segregation explains that
  variation. Using roughly 300 million standardized test score records in math and ELA for
  grades 3 through 8 from every U.S. public school district during the 2008-09 to 2014-15 school
  years, we estimate intraclass correlations (ICCs) as a measure of between-district variation.
  We characterize the variation in the ICCs across states, as well as the patterns in the ICCs over
  subjects, grades and cohorts. Further, we investigate the relationship between the ICCs and
  measures of racial and socioeconomic segregation. We find that between-district variation is
  greatest, on average, in states with high levels of both white-black and economic segregation.
