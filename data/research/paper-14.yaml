abstract: |
  Although trends in the racial segregation of schools are well documented, less is known
  about trends in income segregation. We use multiple data sources to document trends in
  income segregation between schools and school districts. Between-district income
  segregation of families with children enrolled in public school increased by over 15% from
  1990 to 2010. Within large districts, between-school segregation of students who are eligible
  and ineligible for free lunch increased by over 40% from 1991 to 2012. Consistent with research
  on neighborhood segregation, we find that rising income inequality contributed to the rise in
  income segregation between schools and districts during this period. The rise in income
  segregation between both schools and districts may have serious implications for inequality
  in studentsâ€™ access to resources that bear on academic achievement.
