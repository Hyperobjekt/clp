abstract: |
  Prior research suggests that males outperform females, on average, on multiple-choice items
  compared to their relative performance on constructed-response items. This paper
  characterizes the extent to which gender achievement gaps on state accountability tests
  across the United States are associated with those tests’ item formats. Using roughly eight
  million fourth and eighth grade students’ scores on state assessments, we estimate state- and
  district-level math and reading male-female achievement gaps. We find that the estimated
  gaps are strongly associated with the proportions of the test scores based on multiple-choice
  and constructed-response questions on state accountability tests, even when controlling for
  gender achievement gaps as measured by the NAEP or NWEA MAP assessments, which have
  the same item format across states. We find that test item format explains approximately 25
  percent of the variation in gender achievement gaps among states.
